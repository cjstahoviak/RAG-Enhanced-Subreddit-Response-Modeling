I think it's because of a frustration at a lack of news from team cherry while mongoose rodeo shares information at a consistent rate. Tho even then the take is still weird and you're right.

Ahh the ol‚Äô post history dig up. I had never heard it used that way. I asked a question. You asked a question. I answered it. You got mad and frantically looked for something to throw back at me. You could have taken 2 seconds to google ‚Äúis silksong out‚Äù instead of spamming and getting mad. You don‚Äôt think you would have seen ANYTHING about it being out before this post? No online hype? No articles? Just a screenshot of a boss? Zero critical thinking skills. Gullible and simple. Maybe lay off the weed for a bit, and make sure you‚Äôre wearing your helmet when you bike. Gotta protect that single brain cell.

They announced at that State of Play that 'Stray' would be free to people signed up to the new higher tiers of PS Plus that are starting this month.

I suspect Silksong could be one of the next 'free' games they announce.

I feel like it's better if we just *don't* let people know about game shows. If Silksong is shown, we'll definitely find out, and if it's not then no one will have to be disappointed.
